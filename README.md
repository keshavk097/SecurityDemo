Implemented a simple Spring Boot application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on an entity called `Product`. 
The application uses an embedded H2 database for data storage and JWT-based token authentication for security. Unauthorized users are unable to access the CRUD operations without a valid JWT token.
